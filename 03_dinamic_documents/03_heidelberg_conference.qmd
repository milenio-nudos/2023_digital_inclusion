# Introduction

The next report contains a first exploration of the digital inclusion 2023 survey, that is oriented for the presentation of Teresa Correa on Heidelberg University. In this case, the exploration is about some constructed index about digital knowledge from the database to explain the variation of attitudes to false information on the internet. The independent variables are:

-   Digital skills index (Van Deuersen)

    -   Operational skills index[^1]
    -   Informative skills index[^2]
    -   Social skills index[^3]
    -   Creative skills index[^4]

-   Digital literacy index (Hargittai)[^5]

    -   Social media literacy index
    -   Algorithmic literacy index

-   Algorithmic awareness index (Zarouali)[^6]

-   Political polar position \[Categorical\]

-   Technological anxiety scale [^7]

-   Technological self-efficacy scale [^8]

-   Frequency of use of social media [^9]

    -   Facebook.
    -   Twitter.
    -   Instagram.
    -   Whatsapp.
    -   TikTok.

[^6]: To what extent are you aware of the following statements about the presence of algorithms on social media (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter) and streaming platforms (Netflix, Disney+)?

    1.  Algorithms are used to recommend me content (videos, photos, movies, series) on social networks and streaming platforms

    2.  Algorithms are used to prioritise certain content (videos, photos, movies, series) over others on social networks and streaming platforms.

    3.  The content (videos, photos, movies, series) that the algorithms recommend to me depends on my behaviour on social networks and streaming platforms.

    4.  The content (videos, photos, movies, series) recommended to me by algorithms depends on the data I provide on social networks and streaming platforms.

    5.  The use of my personal data in the algorithms has consequences for my online privacy.

    6.  The content (videos, photos, movies, series) recommended by algorithms may be subject to human biases such as prejudice or stereotypes.

[^7]: On a scale of 1 to 3, where 1 means "Never" and 3 means "Frequently" How often do you feel the following?

    1.  I feel nervous when using new technologies

    2.  I avoid using new technologies for fear of making mistakes.

    3.  I think that technological devices and antennas can damage my health.

    4.  I distrust new technologies because other people can obtain private information through it.

[^8]: On a scale of 1 to 3, where 1 means "Never" and 3 means "Frequently" How often do you feel the following?

[^9]: How often do you visit the following sites or use the following applications?

    1.  Every day.

    2.  At least once a week.

    3.  Two or three times a month.

    4.  Never or less than once a month.

The items to predict comes from the next question: *"When you surf the internet or use social media, how often have the following situations occurred to you?"*

And the items are:

-   "I have seen or read false or misleading news"
-   "I have believed news that later turned out to be false or misleading"
-   "I have shared information that subsequently turned out to be false or misleading"

Also, from the same battery was constructed a scale of anti fake news actions of the user. The items that composed the scale are:

-   "I have blocked or unfollowed people for posting false information"
-   "When I have received false or misleading news, I have denied it and made it clear that it is false"
-   "I have criticised someone for disseminating false or misleading information"

# Data description

The table show the different variables, how they were created or calculated, some descriptive statistics and the Cronbach alpha (only for index's). Some advises:

-   Algorithmic awareness index first had 207 missing values (19% of total cases). All of them were recoded as "1" \[Not awareness\].
-   Political polar position variable is a recodification of 1 \[left\] - 10 \[right\] political position scale. Extreme positions of both wings (1,2,3/8,9,10) were recoded as "Polarized" people, center positions (4,5,6,7) were recoded as "Centered" people, and people who don't recognise them with the scale (principally Don't know/ Don't answer) were recoded as "Non-scaled". The last group represent the 55% cases of the sample.
-   Van Deursen's digital skill index is contained totally by the other four index's. Meanwhile, Hargittai's digital literacy index is not totally contained by social media and algorithmic literacy index, because have other items that are not in this scale.
-   All alpha's of mean constructed index's, with at least 95 of confidence, have a score more than 0.90, so the indexs used have internal consistency.

# Correlations

The table shows that all the scales have a positive relation with the fake news variables, but the effect size is more in in fake news reading than believing, sharing or anti-fake news attitudes. One of the strongest relationship are algorithmic awareness and digital literacy.

# Models

Firs models have only one independent scale variable and socio-economical control variables. Results shows Algorithmic awareness, digital literacy and digital skills have a positive significant impact to all fake news attitudes, but tends to be stronger in seeing or reading than in anyone else.

Also, it's interest to mention that rural zones have a significative negative effect in believing in all the scales. People from rural isolated areas recognise they believe more in fake news than others.

### Social media frequency use model

But all this questions are measuring some type of fake news awareness over fake news. To have the awareness about it, it's necessary to be a frequently user of social medias, where the fake news goes viral. This final model include variables of frequency of use of social media to predict fake news attitudes, combinated with algorithmic awareness scale.

The rural type results mantains in this model. Algorithmic awareness have a significative positive effect in reading bt negative in sharing. Then social medias as youtube, twitter or facebook tends to have a positive effect, but others like whatsapp, in general, have a negative effect, specially when it's about sharing and make anti-fake news actions.

In other words, people form Youtube, Twitter or Facebook have more experiencies with fake news, but also more initiative to stop them. Meanwhile Whatsapp users think they do not encounter as much fake news online, nor do they take as much initiative as users of other social media.
